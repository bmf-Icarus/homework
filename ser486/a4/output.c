 * Spring 2018

 * Modified By: JJ Rabago
 *
 * this file implements functions associated with SER486
 * homework assignment 4.  The procedures implemented
 * provide led and console output support for debugging
 * of future SER 486 assignments.
 *
 * functions are:
 *    writestr(char *)  - a function to write an ascii
 *                        null-terminated string to the
 *                        avr atmega 328P uart port.
 *                        (instructor provided)
 *
 *    writehex8(unsigned char) - a function to write the
 *                        hexadecimal representation of
 *                        an 8-bit unsigned integer to
 *                        avr atmega 328P uart port.
 *
 *    writehex16(unsigned int) - a function to write the
 *                        hexadecimal representation of
 *                        a 16-bit unsigned integer to
 *                        avr atmega 328P uart port.
 *
 *    blink_led(char *) - a function to send a specific
 *                        blink pattern to the development
 *                        board's user-programmable LED.
 *
 *    delay(unsigned int) - delay code execution for
 *                        the specified amount of milliseconds.
 *                        (instructor provided)
